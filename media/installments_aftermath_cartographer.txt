# The instructions will mentioned to install python-rosdep or python3-rosdep
# in order to make the global executable rosdep available. That will
# still not be possible even if the Python modules would be separated into
# their own Debian package - only these -modules packages will be
# side-by-side installable.

# ! official docs say you need to install another stuff this way:
# sudo rosdep init
# rosdep update
# rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro=${ROS_DISTRO} -y
# ! But I had problem with rosdistro module and after long time web searching 
# ! found this on ros.org:
# ! rosdistro script is no longer available on recent ROS installations. This page is kept for historical reasons only. 
# ! actually repo is active, so just do next steps on web
# https://google-cartographer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.
# section Getting started without ROS.


# after that I've done one more time in catkin_ws
catkin_make_isolated --install --use-ninja
# probably that doesn't change anything and only invokes ninja again
