# SLAM plus ROS tools overview and report

The repository contains description of my experience of discovering various methods and tools for
Robotic Operating System (ROS) and Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM).

## Goal

This was implemented for [Intelligent Transport Laboratory](https://cogmodel.mipt.ru/itl) as an intro task.

## Tools

* [ROS environment](http://wiki.ros.org/Distributions). In my case melodic version was used.
* [RTAB-Map](http://introlab.github.io/rtabmap/)
* [Cartographer ROS](https://google-cartographer-ros.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

## Articles
* [REAL-TIME 2D AND 3D SLAM USING RTAB-MAP, GMAPPING, AND CARTOGRAPHER PACKAGES](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/326986124_REAL-TIME_2D_AND_3D_SLAM_USING_RTAB-MAP_GMAPPING_AND_CARTOGRAPHER_PACKAGES)
* [RTAB-Map as an Open-Source Lidar and VisualSLAM Library for Large-Scale and Long-Term OnlineOperation](https://introlab.3it.usherbrooke.ca/mediawiki-introlab/images/7/7a/Labbe18JFR_preprint.pdf)

## Main origin
* [rtabmap ros](wiki.ros.org/rtabmap_ros)

## Deps && Installation instructions

maybe one day...
